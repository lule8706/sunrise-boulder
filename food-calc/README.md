This program will determine how many servings of each food item to serve in a certain meal. The first step is taking in either console inputs or a CSV file created according to the guidelines of the Meal class' operator>>, then storing these user inputs in a Meal object. It will then use methods contained in the meal class to determine just how many servings of each meal are needed to feed the number of attendees to the event and store the results in the Meal object. Finally, it will use the Meal class' operator<< to output the final data in the Meal class to a CSV file, which can easily be viewed as a spreadsheet in any widely available spreadsheet editor, such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice, or Numbers. It will also print the results to the console if requested by the user.
